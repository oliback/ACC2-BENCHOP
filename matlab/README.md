To install octave version 4 on Ubuntu: sudo apt-get install octave

Table.m can then be ran with the command: octave Table.m

Also possible to use the Octave gui.

There is a variable called full_test in Table.m. When it is set to 1 all resource intensive tests are run.

On windows, a latex table is produced, on other systems, a simple file with the values is saved.
