# Contextualization

To start instance: run the command "./init_instance.sh" in your command-line client. If you can't make it work on your local computer, just use an Openstack VM, follow Task-0 on Github for Lab 2, clone into this repository and execute the script from there to get the instance started. After that you can ssh into it from your local computer.


# It will take a while for the VM to be completely set up by the config-file!
OBS: Mind the maximum instance-quota in Openstack as you initiate the instance!
